## 🧰 Setup Instructions

### 1. Download and Install Anaconda (if not already installed)
👉 [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or use the pendrive provided by the team

---

### 2. Create and Activate Environment
```bash
conda create --name aspirex_25_cnn_exp python=3.12
conda activate aspirex_25_cnn_exp
```

### 3. Install VS Code
Check if VS Code is installed. If not, download it from the official website or use the pendrive provided by the team.

### 4. Set Up the Project
In Anaconda Prompt, type:
```bash
code .
```

This will open VS Code. The Anaconda environment should automatically be set up in VS Code.

Open terminal in VS Code and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BargavanR/Aspirex_Opencv_workshop.git
cd Aspirex_Opencv_workshop
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install the required packages directly:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas seaborn tensorflow opencv-python
```

### 5. Open and Run Notebooks
1. Open any `.ipynb` file in VS Code
2. At the top right of the notebook, click on "Select Kernel"
3. Choose the environment: `aspirex_25_cnn_exp`
4. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially
